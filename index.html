      <h1>Tegei's Akan Name Calculator</h1>
      <p> In this website, we are going to take your birthday and calculate the
        day of the week you were born and then depending on your gender, we
        will output your Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian
        culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a
        'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
        Here are Ghanian day names. </p>

    <p id="p2">Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and
      Ghana. A child's name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth
      or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender.</p>
